# Caldero

Caldero is a simple web utility app that lets you organize your schedule in the most optimal way possible, so you can master new skills
whilst also juggling your daily responsibilities. 

Caldero Syncs directly to Google Calendar.

The app is based upon the popular concept that it takes 10,000 hours to master a skill. The idea's since been debunked, but generally, 
mastering a skill is a healthy mix of talent and hardwork. Caldero lets you put in the hardwork in a structured way that guarantees you
the best use of your limited time on this planet. 

## How To Use
Right now, you can first clone the app and run it on a simple python server with 
'''
python3.5 -m http.server PORT_NAME
'''

Go authorize the app on Google Calendar API dashboard, and insert your client ID in gcal.js.
